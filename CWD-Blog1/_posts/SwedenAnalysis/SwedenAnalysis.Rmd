  Worldwide, Covid-19 cases are rising unrivalled, exceeding the daily numbers. One thing that is certain is that adjusting . Owing to COVID-19, in the last few months we have experienced an unprecedented change in our way of life and the same applies to this entire globe. Let’s look at the state of this pandemic, in the country of Sweden, also called Sverige in the continent of Europe.

## Get Tested Today, Stop the Spread, Stay Together, Stay Stronger

Coronavirus was first born in Wuhan, China in the first week of December, this viruses causes problems with the respiratory system, thus infecting the body with mild to more severe diseases, this virus is easily contagious, close to contact with an infected individual. Good hand hygiene and cleanliness etiquette, social distancing and of course, the mask, also called the new normal of today are one of the most effective steps to help prevent the virus from entering your system.

The signs of this deadly virus are shown in the figure below, even if you encounter mild symptoms that are being examined today, get tested and help stop this virus from spreading indeed spread more happiness around us.

## Data Sources

It is through data collection that any firm makes quality and powerful informed decisions through further research. Data mining helps them to remain on top of developments, provide solutions to questions, and interpret new ideas to a great extent. In this blog I have used a combination of datasets and thus made, further analysis on the situation of covid-19 in Peru. The dataset, used have been obtained from [Kaggle, COVID -19 country data](https://www.kaggle.com/rajtulluri/covid19-country-data?select=covid19_peru_stats.csv). Another dataset that I found suitable for my analysis was taken from the coronavirus package, this provides the Johns Hopkins University CSSE dataset together with a dashboard owned by [Joachim Gassen - tidycovid19 package](https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19). In addition I have also used the [Coronavirus Source Data by Hannah Ritchie](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data), this dataset, had the latest information of the covid-19 cases. Lets take a glimpse of a few datasets that I have used throughout the analysis process. Data variables are an important part in determining the visualization of the dataset, as well as the scope of the datasets, most variables in the dataset utilized are easy to follow and self explanatory. 

## Overview of COVID-19 in Sweden

The arrival of the virus was seen on 31 January 2020, a woman returning from Wuhan tested positive. Multiple travel linked clusters later began to appear in Sweden. Also already Community transmission in the Stockholm area had started. Unfortunately, Swedish people began losing their lives because of this deadly virus.


```{r}
library(lubridate)
swed_covid <- coronavirus %>% dplyr::filter(country == "Sweden")

swed_covid_longer <- swed_covid %>% pivot_wider(values_from = "cases", names_from  = "type")

swed_covid_longer <- swed_covid_longer %>% mutate(month = month(date),
                                                   day = day(date), 
                                                  week = week(date))
```

```{r over-view, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Overview of the Confirmed Cases and Death Cases in Sweden" }
# libraries:
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(ggplot2)

library(viridis)
library(dplyr)



swed_covid <- swed_covid %>% mutate(month = month(date),
       day = day(date), 
       week = week(date))

swed_covid <- swed_covid %>% dplyr::filter(type %in% c("confirmed" , "death"))

myPlot <- ggplot(swed_covid, aes(x=date, y=cases, group=type, color=type)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + 
  ggtitle("Overview of COVID-19 in Sweden") +

animate(myPlot, 
        fps = 18, 
        renderer = gifski_renderer())
anim_save("output.gif")
```

In the figure \@ref(fig:over-view) helps us to conclude that the covid-19 cases in Sweden in the beginning rose, the country saw its worst time as seen in the graph in about the last week of June and the first week of July. But we are still very amazed that, even though the country was at its highest peak of confirmed cases, the death rate was not very high relative to the positive cases. The higher death rate was only seen in the last weeks of April, but people in Sweden kept the death toll in track. Kudos to the health services in Sweden, which itself also explains the well known fact about the excellent standard of health care in Sweden is excellent, being highly ranked in the world by the World Health Organization.

As we have seen in the figure \@ref(fig:over-view), the graph is multimodal and not a very precise way of displaying the total number of positive cases in Sweden. We must be able to differentiate clearly between the covid-19 scenarios in Sweden for each month and in detail will be a good way to learn more about how this virus affected Sweden.


```{r in-deep, fig.align='center', fig.cap="In depth Insight of Positive Cases in Sweden"}
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)          
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)

data <- swed_covid_longer

data$date <- ymd(data$date)

plot <- xts(x = data$confirmed, order.by = data$date)

p <- dygraph(plot) %>%
  dyOptions(labelsUTC = TRUE, 
            fillGraph=TRUE, 
            fillAlpha=0.1, 
            drawGrid = FALSE, 
            colors="#00FFFF") %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyCrosshair(direction = "vertical") %>%
  dyHighlight(highlightCircleSize = 5, 
              highlightSeriesBackgroundAlpha = 0.2, 
              hideOnMouseOut = FALSE)  %>%
  dyRoller(rollPeriod = 1)

p
```

Figure \@ref(fig:in-deep), is a very cool figure and allows us to play with its graphics, this figure still helps infer in depth awareness of the positive cases in Sweden. Initially, the introduction of this virus in February witnessed zero cases. The graph showed a large rise in the month of April, but Sweden managed this very well and got the situation under control. But just as we thought the environment was under control, the virus displayed a powerful contagious nature and witnessed a massive community transfer of positive cases in Sweden in the months of June and July.

Fortunately, the cases were once again brought under the control by the officials of the Sweden government. Wait !! What ??. Our research study tells us that Sweden is the only country in the world that has not had a lockdown. Yeah, you've read that correctly, Sweden has effectively managed to monitor the situation , without any lockdown.

## The Lockdown Reflex

Our further research, focused on the lockdown, informs us that Sweden has officials who believe that the lockdown is a severe policy move and that its effects will not become clear for some time to come. The after effects will give rise in inequality, also unemployment and corporate bankruptcy will increase due to a imposed lockdown.

Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven urged each person to take responsibility for their own health and the health of others and to obey the recommendations of the Swedish Public Health Agency. Research tells us that Sweden has taken self-responsibility, and that the majority of citizens of Sweden have adopted the recommendations rather than the restrictions.

So we're correcting the point we made above, and we have to give full credit to the Swedish Republicans, that they've written history in this pandemic, and that Sweden, being the only country, has managed to minimize both the reported and the death toll of covid-19 cases in the country. Woah!! Sweden.
