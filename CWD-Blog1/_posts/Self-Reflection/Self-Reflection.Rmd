title: "Learning from Self-Reflection"
description: |
  The willingness of humans to cultivate introspection and to make an effort to understand more about their actions, can be termed as human self-reflection. The secret to self-awareness it helps us to look rationally at our actions. In this blog, let us review, introspect and engage in the act of self reflection for the first ever shiny app I ever made in my life. ”What we perceive about ourselves is greatly a reflection of how we will end up living our lives.” – Stephen Richards

## My First Ever Shiny App

A little history of me and R. I've had a very cordial and user-friendly relationship with R for around 9 months now. I was in a total mess initially when I was first introduced to it. I still remember my first class at Monash University, where Professor Stuart Lee taught us about clean data formats and I didn't even know how to create a folder in R during the hands-on session. Looking back at those days, from there to now, it gives me a tiny, (literally very tiny) sense of pride in my journey from not knowing R at all to now building my first ever shiny app.
